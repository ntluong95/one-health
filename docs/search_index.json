In many cases, the exposures are risk factors and the outcome is a disease of interest. However, this is not the only scenario; for example, our outcome of interest might be a measure of productivity or food safety and the exposures might include certain diseases. Figure 1.1. Key components of epidemiologic research Ultimately, we aim to make causal inferences (bottom right of diagram) and Chapter 1 discusses some important concepts of causation as they relate to epidemiologic research. Any study starts with an overall study design and the main observational study types are discussed in Chapters 1.5 In any study, it is important to identify the target population and obtain a study group from it in a manner that does not lead to selection bias. Sampling and selection bias is discussed in Chapter 1.2 Once we have identified our study subjects, it is necessary to obtain data on exposure variables, extraneous variables and the outcome in a manner that does not lead to information bias (Chapter 12). Two important tools that are used in that process are questionnaires (Chapter 3) and diagnostic and screening tests (Chapter 5). In order to start the process of establishing an association between exposure and outcome, we need to settle on a measure of disease frequency (Chapter 4) and select a measure of association (Chapter 6) that fits the context. In many cases, the study design will determine the measures that are appropriate. Confounding bias is a major concern in observational studies, and the identification of factors that should be controlled as confounders is featured in Chapter 13. With our data in hand, we are now able to begin to model relationships with the intent of estimating causal effects of exposure (Chapter 13). Individual chapters are dedicated to the analyses appropriate for outcomes that are continuous (Chapter 14), dichotomous (Chapter 16), nominal/ordinal (Chapter 17), count (Chapter 18) and time-to-event data (Chapter 19). Chapter 15 presents some general guide lines on model-building techniques that are applicable to ali types of model. In veterinary epidemiologic research, we often encounter clustered or correlated data and these present major challenges in their analyses. Chapter 20 introduces these while Chapters 21 and 22 focus on mixed (random effects) models for continuous and discrete outcomes. Chapter 23 presents some alternative methods of analysis for dealing with clustered data. Structured reviews and assessments of the literature in the form of meta-analyses are becoming increasingly important and are introduced in Chapter 24. Not all studies allow us to collect data on exposures and outcomes at the individual level and yet there is much that we can learn by studying disease in groups (eg herds). Thus, ecologic studies are introduced in Chapter 25. Finally, we complete the text with Chapter 26 which provides a road map for investigators starting into the analysis of a complex epidemiologic dataset. 1.2 Sampling Chapter 2 và Chapter 12 1.3 Measures of diseases frequency 1.4 Measures of association 1.5 Introduction about different studies design Chapter 7-11 1.5.1 Introduction about observational study 1.5.2 Introduction about longitudinal study 1.5.3 Controlled trials 1.6 Confounder bias "],["basic-data-analysis.html", "Chapter 2 Basic Data analysis 2.1 Introduction about work flow 2.2 Software installation 2.3 Create working environment 2.4 Data Manipulation 2.5 Data visualization 2.6 Communication with Rmarkdown 2.7 ShinyApp", " Chapter 2 Basic Data analysis 2.1 Introduction about work flow The picture below described about a normal working process of data analysis. First you must import your data. This typically means that you take data stored in a file, database, or web application programming interface (API), and load it into the software. In this course, we will work with .xlsx and .csv file, which are the most common type of storaging data The next steps are Tidying and Transforming your data. Combining 2 steps, we have the so-called Data Wrangling. Tidying your data means storing it in a consistent form that matches the semantics of the dataset with the way it is stored. In brief, when your data is tidy, each column is a variable, and each row is an observation. Once you have tidy data, a common first step is to transform it. Transformation includes narrowing in on observations of interest, creating new variables that are functions of existing variables, and calculating a set of summary statistics (like counts or means). Visualization is a fundamentally human activity. A good visualization will show you things that you did not expect, or raise new questions about the data. A good visualization might also hint that youre asking the wrong question, or you need to collect different data. Visualizations can surprise you, but dont scale particularly well because they require a human to interpret them. Models are complementary tools to visualization. Once you have made your questions sufficiently precise, you can use a model to answer them. Models are a fundamentally mathematical or computational tool, so they generally scale well. But every model makes assumptions, and by its very nature a model cannot question its own assumptions. That means a model cannot fundamentally surprise you. The last step of data science is Communication, an absolutely critical part of any data analysis project. It doesnt matter how well your models and visualization have led you to understand the data unless you can also communicate your results to others. 2.2 Software installation In this course, I will introduce you about the three most powerful statistical softwares including R, Python and STATA, their usage and their advantages as well as disadvantages. While R and Python is more a programming language, which can be a hurdle for some people, STATA is more user-friendly and balance between using Graphical User Interface (GUI) and saving script (do file). In short, youll need to install the following programs in order: R: A statistical programming language used to wrangle, analyze, and visualize data (mac, windows) RStudio: An interface for writing and running R code, which is a primary language for the quarter (link). You can download a developing version here, which will provide most up-to-date new features Python: Another programming language, be preferred in machine learning, deep learning, AI. In this tutorial, we will install Python indirectly through package reticulate in R. More details will be presented later Git: (Optional) A set of command-line tools for tracking changes to a project. This is likely already installed on Macs. The Windows download will come with Git Bash, a simple interface for executing Git commands (link) STATA: This is paid software. You have to buy it before use or you can download a trial version here The following sections have additional information about the purpose of each component, how to install it, and alternative configurations. 2.2.1 R 2.2.2 Rstudio 2.2.3 Python 2.2.4 Setting environment for R and Python 2.2.5 STATA 2.3 Create working environment 2.4 Data Manipulation 2.5 Data visualization 2.6 Communication with Rmarkdown 2.7 ShinyApp "],["regression-models.html", "Chapter 3 Regression models", " Chapter 3 Regression models install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) a &lt;- b + c Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #.
