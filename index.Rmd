# Basic Epidemiology

**OBJECTIVES**

After reading this chapter, reader should be able to:

-   Construct a logical causal diagram based on your area of research interest as an aid to guiding your study design and analyses

-   Select the appropriate sampling strategy for a particular situation, taking into account the requirements, advantages and disadvantages of each method.

-   Identify the different types of selection bias and assess whether or not a particular study is likely to suffer from excess selection bias.

-   Explain the different ways of measuring disease frequency and differentiate among counts, proportions, odds and rates.

-   Calculate and interpret the following measures of association: risk ratio, odds ratio, incidence rate ratio, risk difference (attributable risk), attributable fraction (exposed), population attributable risk, attributable fraction (population).

-   Understand the strength and weaknesses of various study designs for the identification and evaluation of causal factors.

## About the book

Our rationale for doing research is to identify potentially causal associations between **exposures and outcomes** (the center of the diagram). In many cases, the exposures are risk factors and the outcome is a disease of interest. However, this is not the only scenario; for example, our outcome of interest might be a measure of productivity or food safety and the exposures might include certain diseases.

Ultimately, we aim to make causal inferences (bottom right of diagram) and Chapter 1 discusses some important concepts of causation as they relate to epidemiologic research. Any study starts with an overall study design and the main observational study types are discussed in *Chapters 1.6.* In any study, it is important to identify the target population and obtain a study group from it in a manner that does not lead to selection bias. Sampling and selection bias is discussed in *Chapter 1.3.* Once we have identified our study subjects, it is necessary to obtain data on exposure variables, extraneous variables and the outcome in a manner that does not lead to information bias (*Chapter 1.7*). Two important tools that are used in that process are questionnaires (*Chapter 1.4*) and diagnostic and screening tests (*Chapter 1.4*). In order to start the process of establishing an association between exposure and outcome, we need to settle on a measure of disease frequency (*Chapter 1.3*) and select a measure of association (*Chapter 1.5*) that fits the context. In many cases, the study design will determi4e the measures that are appropriate. Confounding bias is a major concern in observational studies, and the identification of factors that should be controlled as confounders is featured in *Chapter 1.7*.

Basic data analysis will be presented in *Chapter 2*. You will learn essential skills to conduct data analysis with different programming languages such as R and Python or statistical software like STATA. You will also introduced on how to communicate your works with other scientists and readers using Rmarkdown (*Chapter 2.7*) and ShinyApp (*Chapter 2.8*). *Chapter 2.9* will provides you a road map for investigators starting into the analysis of an epidemiologic dataset.

With our data in hand, we are now able to begin to model relationships with the intent of estimating causal effects of exposure (*Chapter 3*). Individual chapters are dedicated to the analyses appropriate for outcomes that are continuous (*Chapter 3.2*), dichotomous (*Chapter 3.3*), nominal/ordinal (*Chapter 3.4*), count (*Chapter 3.5*) and time-to-event data (*Chapter 3.6*). *Chapter 3.1* presents some general guide lines on model-building techniques that are applicable to all types of model. In one health epidemiologic research, we often encounter clustered or correlated data and these present major challenges in their analyses. *Chapter 3.7.1* introduces these while *Chapters 3.7.2* and *Chapters 3.7.3* focus on mixed (random effects) models for continuous and discrete outcomes. *Chapters 3.7.4* presents some alternative methods of analysis for dealing with clustered data.

Other important tools in epidemiology, including Risk analysis (*Chapter 4*), Spatial epidemiology (*Chapter 5*), Estimating true prevalence of a diseases (*Chapter 6*) and Infections diseases modelling (*Chapter 7*) will also be discussed

Other models and tools will be mentioned in *Chapter 8*. Structured reviews and assessments of the literature in the form of meta-analyses are becoming increasingly important and are introduced in *Chapter 8.3*. In *Chapter 9*, we will introduce about digital data collection tool (*Chapter 9.1*) and visualization tools (*Chapter 9.2*)

## Causual concept

### Experimental versus observational evidence

**Experimental evidence**

A major goal for epidemiologic research is to identify factors that can be manipulated to maximise health or prevent disease. In other words, we need to identify causes of health and disease. For our purposes, *a cause is any factor that produces a change in the severity or frequency of the outcome*. In searching for causes, we stress the holistic approach to health. The term holistic might suggest that we try to identify and measure every suspected causal factor for the outcome of interest. Yet, quite clearly, we cannot consider every possible factor in a single study. Rather, we place limits on the portion of the "real world" we study and, within this, we constrain the list of factors we identify for investigation.

Traditionally, the gold standard approach to identifying causal factors is to perform an experiment. In the ideal experiment, we randomise some animals (or human) to receive the factor and some to receive nothing, a placebo, or a standard intervention (treatment). In this context, exposure X is a proven cause of outcome Y, if in an ideal experiment X is changed and, as a result, the value or state of Y also changes. In this example, X explicitly precedes Y temporally and an variables (known and unknown) that do not intervene between X and Y are made independent of X through the process of randomisation (this means that extraneous variables do not confound or bias the results we attribute to the exposure X). Factors that are positioned temporally or causally between X and Y are not measured and are of no concern with respect to answering the causal objective of the trial.

The measure of causation in this ideal trial is called the causal *effect coefficient* and indicates the difference in the outcome between the 'treated' and 'non-treated' groups. For example, if the risk of the outcome in the group receiving the treatment is denoted R1 and the risk in the group not receiving the treatment is R0, then we might choose to measure the effect of treatment using either an absolute measure (ie risk difference - RD) or a relative measure (ie risk ratio - RR). If this difference is greater than what could be attributed to chance, then we would say that we have proved that the factor is a cause of the outcome event. A key point is that all causal-effect statements are based on *contrasts* of treatment levels; the outcome in the treated group cannot be interpreted without knowing the outcome in the untreated group. A second key feature is *exchangeability*; that is the same outcome would be observed (except for sampling error) if the assignments of treatment to study subjects had been reversed (ie if the treated group had been assigned to be untreated). Randomisation provides the probabilistic basis for the validity of this assumption.
