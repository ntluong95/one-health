# Basic Epidemiology

**OBJECTIVES**

After reading this chapter, reader should be able to:

-   Select the appropriate sampling strategy for a particular situation, taking into account the requirements, advantages and disadvantages of each method.

-   Identify the different types of selection bias and assess whether or not a particular study is likely to suffer from excess selection bias

-   Explain the different ways of measuring disease frequency and differentiate among counts, proportions, odds and rates

-   Calculate and interpret the following measures of association: risk ratio, odds ratio, incidence rate ratio, risk difference (attributable risk), attributable fraction (exposed), population attributable risk, attributable fraction (population)

-   Understand the strength and weaknesses of various study designs for the identification and evaluation of causal factors.

## About the book

Our rationale for doing research is to identify potentially causal associations between **exposures and outcomes** (the center of the diagram). In many cases, the exposures are risk factors and the outcome is a disease of interest. However, this is not the only scenario; for example, our outcome of interest might be a measure of productivity or food safety and the exposures might include certain diseases.

Ultimately, we aim to make causal inferences (bottom right of diagram) and Chapter 1 discusses some important concepts of causation as they relate to epidemiologic research. Any study starts with an overall study design and the main observational study types are discussed in *Chapters 1.5.* In any study, it is important to identify the target population and obtain a study group from it in a manner that does not lead to selection bias. Sampling and selection bias is discussed in *Chapter 1.2.* Once we have identified our study subjects, it is necessary to obtain data on exposure variables, extraneous variables and the outcome in a manner that does not lead to information bias (*Chapter 1.6*). Two important tools that are used in that process are questionnaires (*Chapter 1.3*) and diagnostic and screening tests (*Chapter 1.3*). In order to start the process of establishing an association between exposure and outcome, we need to settle on a measure of disease frequency (*Chapter 1.3*) and select a measure of association (*Chapter 1.4*) that fits the context. In many cases, the study design will determine the measures that are appropriate. Confounding bias is a major concern in observational studies, and the identification of factors that should be controlled as confounders is featured in *Chapter 1.6*.

Basic data analysis will be presented in *Chapter 2*. You will learn essential skills to conduct data analysis with different programming languages such as R and Python or statistical software like STATA. *Chapter 2.6* will provides you a road map for investigators starting into the analysis of an epidemiologic dataset. You will also introduced on how to communicate your works with other scientists and readers using Rmarkdown (*Chapter 2.7*) and ShinyApp (*Chapter 2.8*).

With our data in hand, we are now able to begin to model relationships with the intent of estimating causal effects of exposure (*Chapter 3*). Individual chapters are dedicated to the analyses appropriate for outcomes that are continuous (*Chapter 3.2*), dichotomous (*Chapter 3.3*), nominal/ordinal (*Chapter 3.4*), count (*Chapter 3.5*) and time-to-event data (*Chapter 3.6*). *Chapter 3.1* presents some general guide lines on model-building techniques that are applicable to all types of model. In one health epidemiologic research, we often encounter clustered or correlated data and these present major challenges in their analyses. *Chapter 3.7.1* introduces these while *Chapters 3.7.2* and *Chapters 3.7.3* focus on mixed (random effects) models for continuous and discrete outcomes. *Chapters 3.7.4* presents some alternative methods of analysis for dealing with clustered data.

Other important tools in epidemiology, including Risk analysis (*Chapter 4*), Spatial epidemiology (*Chapter 5*), Estimating true prevalence of a diseases (*Chapter 6*) and Infections diseases modelling (*Chapter 7*) will also be discussed

Other models and tools will be mentioned in *Chapter 8*. Structured reviews and assessments of the literature in the form of meta-analyses are becoming increasingly important and are introduced in *Chapter 8.3*. In *Chapter 9*, we will introduce about digital data collection tool (*Chapter 9.1*) and visualization tools (*Chapter 9.2*)
